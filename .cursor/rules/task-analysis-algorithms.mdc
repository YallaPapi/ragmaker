Core Task Analysis Components:

1. Task Complexity Scoring
Path: taskmaster/scripts/modules/task-manager/analyze-task-complexity.js
- Custom 1-10 complexity scale based on multiple weighted factors:
  - Implementation difficulty 
  - Integration requirements
  - Test coverage needs
  - Research complexity
  - Dependency count
- Historical complexity correlation
- Pattern-based score adjustments
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Dependency Resolution Engine
Path: taskmaster/scripts/modules/task-manager/find-next-task.js
- Multi-level dependency chain analysis
- Circular dependency prevention
- Automatic bottleneck detection
- Critical path identification
- Smart task unblocking
Importance Score: 85/100

3. AI Task Generation System
Path: taskmaster/scripts/modules/task-manager/research.js
- Context-aware task breakdown
- Smart subtask generation based on complexity thresholds
- Implementation pattern detection
- Research-driven task expansion
- Source attribution tracking
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Scope Adjustment Algorithm
Path: taskmaster/scripts/modules/task-manager/scope-adjustment.js
- Dynamic task scaling based on complexity analysis
- Intelligent subtask preservation during scope changes
- Strength-based scaling modes (light/regular/heavy)
- Context-aware task regeneration
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Business Rules:
1. Tasks above complexity 7 require automatic breakdown
2. Minimum one independent subtask per parent task
3. Maximum dependency depth of 5 levels
4. Mandatory complexity recalculation on scope changes
5. Research integration required for complexity scores > 8
