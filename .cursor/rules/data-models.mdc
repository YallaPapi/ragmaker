description: Defines core task data models, relationships, and state transitions for AI-assisted task management system
---


# data-models

Task Core Data Model:
- Hierarchical task structure with parent-child relationships
- Task states: pending, in-progress, review, done, deferred
- Complexity scoring (1-10 scale) with historical tracking
- Tag-based organization supporting multiple working contexts
- Direct and inherited dependency tracking

Task State Transitions:
- Enforced workflow progression: pending -> in-progress -> review -> done
- Deferred state allowed from any active state
- Parent task status derived from subtask states
- Automatic dependency status propagation
- State preservation during AI-driven updates

Task Relationships:
- Multi-level parent-child hierarchies
- Cross-reference dependency mapping
- Tag-based grouping and isolation
- Branch-specific task contexts
- Complexity inheritance patterns

Task Metadata:
- AI-generated complexity scores
- Historical complexity adjustments
- Implementation progress tracking
- Research context references
- Source branch mappings
