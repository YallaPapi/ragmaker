## Task Lifecycle Workflows

### Primary Task States
- Pending → In Progress → Review → Done/Deferred
- State transitions managed through TaskMaster MCP protocol
- AI-driven state validation ensures workflow compliance
- Automatic dependency state propagation through task graph

### Data Flow Patterns
1. Task Creation Flow
- Complexity analysis determines initial task structure
- AI-driven subtask generation based on complexity score
- Parent-child relationship establishment with dependency tracking
- Tag context assignment for workflow isolation

2. Task Update Flow
- Optimistic UI updates with background sync
- State preservation during AI-assisted modifications
- Completed work protection during scope changes
- Cross-reference integrity maintenance

3. Task Synchronization 
- Adaptive polling based on task activity patterns
- Activity-based interval calculations for sync timing
- Multi-view coordination (webview, sidebar, editor)
- Offline state caching with conflict resolution

### State Management
1. Context Management
- Hierarchical context gathering with token-aware truncation
- Intelligent merging of multiple context types
- Dependency-aware context building
- Format-specific context presentation

2. Tag-Based Organization
- Business-specific tag lifecycle management  
- Git branch-to-tag mapping for development workflow
- Isolated task states with relationship preservation
- Cross-context metadata synchronization

3. Scope Control
- Dynamic complexity-based scope adjustment
- Work preservation during scope changes
- Strength-based scaling (light/regular/heavy)
- Intelligent subtask regeneration

### Data Synchronization
- Token-based incremental sync
- Cross-component state coordination
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Cache invalidation rules
