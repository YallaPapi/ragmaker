## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Task Master Core Architecture

Central Business Components:

1. AI Task Analysis Engine
- Complexity scoring system (1-10 scale) with multi-factor analysis
- Task decomposition based on complexity thresholds
- Intelligent dependency chain management
- Research-backed task expansion using multiple AI providers

2. Provider Management System
- Hierarchical AI model selection (main/research/fallback roles)
- Provider-specific response parsing and error handling
- Custom JSON repair and validation for AI responses
- Token limit management and formatting per provider

3. Task Management Core
- Hierarchical task relationships with parent-child tracking
- Dynamic scope adjustment based on complexity analysis
- Context-aware task organization with tag-based branching
- Automated task progression based on dependency completion

4. Project Analysis Engine
- PRD parsing with automatic task generation
- Dependency graph construction from requirements
- Implementation drift detection
- Context preservation across task updates

Integration Points:

1. AI Service Layer
- Unified provider interface with capability validation
- Session-based interaction management
- Response normalization across providers
- Error recovery with provider fallback chain

2. Task Orchestration
- Parallel execution management with resource limits
- Smart blocking/unblocking based on dependencies
- Continuous task graph reassessment
- Code change integration for status updates

3. Context Management
- State tracking across task operations
- Cache management with task-specific TTLs
- Metadata persistence between branches
- Context switching with relationship preservation

Importance Score: 85/100
